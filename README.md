<h1>Attention Graydon! The fight functions don't work when you run the code! Please try to figure out what is wrong. Also, please read the rest</h1>

<h2>The runner and classes work, but we need to add rooms 11-15, and add a question to RoomEight and then debug the whole thing and make sure that the story lines up with each room. The player.killPlayer() function might not work so test that out too. Thanks!</h2>
MUST DO GIT PULL ORIGIN to update any files
